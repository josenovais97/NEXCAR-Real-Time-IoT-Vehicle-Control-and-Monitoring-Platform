1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,100
First we have a temperature sensor

2
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:12,000
which turns on the AC

3
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:14,533
as soon as the temperature rises.

4
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,767
Next we have a flame sensor

5
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,700
that alerts us in case of fire.

6
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:20,900
We also have a rear sensor

7
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:22,900
that detects when we're nearing an object

8
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:23,867
and triggers a buzzer.

9
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,300
Next, we have a rain sensor

10
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:33,367
that automatically activates
the windshield wipers,

11
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,067
and finally

12
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:36,567
a light sensor that switches
on the cars headlights

13
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:38,100
when it detects darkness.

14
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:42,333
All of this data is collected
and sampled in real time.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,300
Moving on to our web platform,

16
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:46,367
customers log in to a home page

17
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:47,600
that greets them and presents

18
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:49,467
a map of the current location,

19
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:51,200
complete with live traffic data

20
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,033
and nearby fuel stations.

21
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:58,433
Customers can also submit
any questions they may have.

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,267
And a site administrator
will respond promptly.

23
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:07,100
They can also add vehicles
to their fleet and view real time data

24
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,133
along with insightful

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,633
statistics while filtering
that information

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,533
for any time period they choose.

27
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,133
Administrators can view
every vehicle in the system,

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,333
delete cars and filter
records

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,667
by customer name.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
They also receive
and handle customer enquiries.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,033
Another feature available
to both customers and administrators

32
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,000
is vehicle data comparison.

33
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,767
Customers can compare only their own cars,

34
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:02,067
whereas the admin can select
any car in the

35
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,533
system for comparison.

36
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:10,133
We've also developed a mobile app

37
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,933
that mirrors all the features
of the web interface.

38
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,867
It adds extra convenience
for our customers

39
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:17,667
and delivers push notifications

40
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:18,067
whenever

41
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:20,400
the in vehicle sensors detect fire,

42
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,333
a collision or interior movement
that could signal

43
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,267
a theft attempt.

44
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,667
The alerts rely on the flame sensor,

45
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:30,133
accelerometer and motion sensor
installed in each

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,367
car.
